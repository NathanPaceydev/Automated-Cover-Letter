# Automated-Cover-Letter
Script to automate cover letter docs.

Ever wanted more time to work on the projects. No. Just don't want to write 100000 of the same cover letter with slightly changed wording. Yeah me too. Just upload a master_cover_letter.doc like I did and let the script do all the work. just make sure to indicate the variables in the doc using the {{}} notation. ie {{location}}, {{position_title}}...

Then run the python script and boom you have your cover letter saved to the file directory.
I included links to my GitHub and my GrabCad as well as images of my past work in the orginal document.
